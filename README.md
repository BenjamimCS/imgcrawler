This is script is made for scrapping a page and get
the images in it. Isn't a real tool, but it can be
useful sometimes.

Sometimes the website tries to prevent bots to access it, but
in some websites i noticed the image for preview has the same
basename as the real image, i just had to replace the dirname.
